# What is this?

A woocommerce plugin that allows finer control over the action that is performed when adding to the cart including:

- Ability to set where you're redirected when you add a product
- Ability to set different redirections on variations
- Ability to use the parents redirect rule for variations
- Ability to use the globally defined woocommerce setting

Anything Else

- It does everything that https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-add-cart-redirect/ does, but is $29.00 cheaper ;)

## Need this tweaking?

Drop me an email hello@kevinruscoe.me and we'll sort something out.
