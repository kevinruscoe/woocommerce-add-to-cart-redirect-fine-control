# What is this?

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/05b980d565a341f3a272b031f9b92ef0)](https://app.codacy.com/app/kevdotbadger/woocommerce-after-add-to-cart?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=kevinruscoe/woocommerce-after-add-to-cart&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

A woocommerce plugin that allows finer control over the action that is performed when adding to the cart including:

- Ability to set where you're redirected when you add a product
- Ability to set different redirections on variations
- Ability to use the parents redirect rule for variations
- Ability to use the globally defined woocommerce setting

Anything Else

- It does everything that https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-add-cart-redirect/ does, but is $29.00 cheaper ;)
